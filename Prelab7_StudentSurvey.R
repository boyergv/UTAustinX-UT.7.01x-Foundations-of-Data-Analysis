# Write Your Conclusion

# Answer the question and support your answer with statistics:
        
#         In this lab, we knew the average name length for our population of college students.
# The population mean was 5.97 letters and the standard deviation was 1.49. The name lengths 
# were normally distributed. 

# We drew samples of different sizes from our population to simulate the Central Limit Theorem.
# In short, the CLT says three things:
# 1. As sample size increases, sampling distributions become more normal.
# 2. The mean of the sampling distribution will be the population mean. 
# 3. The variability of the sample means can be predicted by dividing the population standard 
# deviation by the square root of the sample size.

# Our simulation results were consistent with this theory. As we increased the size of our sample
# from 5 to 25, the sample means become less variable and tended to cluster more tightly around the
# true mean. In other words, our sample means became better estimators of the true population mean.
