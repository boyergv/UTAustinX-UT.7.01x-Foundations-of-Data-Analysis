# Check the Variables of Interest

# 4a) Which variable tells us the record setting time or distance? The variable name
# in the dataset is:
# Record

# 4b) What type of variable is this?
# Quantitative

# 4c) Which variable tells us when the record was broken? The variable name in the
# dataset is:
# Year

# 4d) What type of variable is this?
# Quantitative

# Reflect on the Method

# 5) Which method should we be using for this analysis and why?
# The scatterplot will show us if these two numeric variables are linearly related. 

# 6) What will we be able to determine once we fit a linear model to this shotput 
# world record data?
# We will be able to report the average rate of change in world record shotput
# distance per year.

# Write Your Conclusion
        
# Based on scatterplots of the menfs and womenfs world record shotput distance, 
# both of these events follow a strong positive linear relationship over 
# time. The menfs world record distance increases by an average of 0.134
# meters per year, while the womenfs record distance increases by an average of 0.234
# meters per year. Because the intercept estimate is the value of the
# record distance when year is equal to 0, it is not interpretable in the
# context of the problem. Both linear models fit the data well, with R-squared values for
# the menfs and womenfs models equal to 0.941 and 0.962, respectively
